# solo-project
- In client.tsx we have "room" and "hostId" that are exactly the same thing lol.
- Typescript? more like AnyScript. Gotta fix that.
- ALL our fetchs should be correctly converted to try-catch :')
- More comments!
- Moving stuff: Frontend fetchs should be inside a service folder.
- Moving stuff: Maybe backend fetches should be separed by functionalities instead of having 300 lines of code inside Controller.js
- Try to add more comments again.
- versel

BUGS:
- security on inputs



- styling to hell

future features?:
- Host should have more functionalities for their room. Change the name? able to add same song multiple times?
- When host closes the web it shouldn't allow people to add more songs... Or should it? Right now it has 1 hour, maybe its decent this way.


scaling:
- Technically, if we want to scale this, our backend array of users should be a hashtable.
